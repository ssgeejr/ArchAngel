## SOAPUI

SoapUI is a testing tool, free for non-commercial use and can be found here: 

https://www.soapui.org/tools/soapui/

Install the application and import the project file. Note, you may have to change the endpoint as cicdmojo.live is only a test endpoint that is not publicly availble - change the domain to localhost instead
